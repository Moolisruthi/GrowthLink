# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

## 🎯 Task Objectives

This project aims to develop a **classification model** to accurately identify **Iris flower species** based on four numerical features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The model classifies flowers into one of **three species**:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

### 📌 Project Goals:
- Preprocess the dataset and handle missing data
- Visualize data distribution and feature relationships
- Train a classification model using **Random Forest**
- Identify the most important features affecting classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Build a prediction function for new input data

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moolisruthi/GrowthLink
cd iris-classification

🧹 Preprocessing Steps
	•	Dropped unnecessary Id column
	•	Stripped column names of whitespaces
	•	Handled missing values (if any)
	•	Encoded species labels using LabelEncoder

🧠 Model Selection
	•	Model: Random Forest Classifier
	•	Reason: Robust ensemble model with high accuracy and built-in feature importance
	•	Train/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

📈 Model Evaluation
	•	Accuracy: > 95%
	•	Metrics Used:
	•	Accuracy Score
	•	Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
	•	Confusion Matrix
	•	Feature Importance Scores

All results are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib for clarity.

 Code Quality
	•	Modular, clean, and well-commented Python code
	•	Consistent naming conventions
	•	Follows PEP-8 styling guidelines
	•	Visualizations are clear and labeled.
